    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <p>
      We are a small team focused on building clean, fast, and maintainable
      websites. Our goal is to create simple solutions that are easy to use
      and easy to grow.
    </p>

    <p>
      We believe good design should be accessible, responsive, and
      straightforward. Every project starts with understanding the problem
      and ends with a solution that works across mobile, tablet, and desktop.
    </p>
